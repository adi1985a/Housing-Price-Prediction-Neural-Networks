## 📄 Overview

This project presents an advanced **Neural Network model for predicting housing prices** within Polish cities. By analyzing a comprehensive set of features—including geographical location (latitude, longitude), floor level, number of rooms, property size (square meters), and year of construction—the model employs sophisticated regression techniques to deliver accurate property price estimations. Developed using **Python** and powered by **TensorFlow**, this project encompasses the entire machine learning pipeline: from meticulous data preprocessing and model construction to rigorous training, thorough evaluation, and insightful visualization of the prediction results. It serves as a powerful tool for real estate market analysis and data-driven decision-making.

## ✨ Key Features

*   🧠 **Accurate Price Prediction**: Utilizes a deep neural network (DNN) for precise regression of housing prices.
*   📊 **Comprehensive Data Processing**: Efficiently handles diverse property features, including geographic coordinates, structural details, and temporal information.
*   🛠️ **Modular & Organized Scripts**: Well-structured codebase with separate Python scripts for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation, promoting clarity and maintainability.
*   📈 **Insightful Visualization**: Generates informative scatter plots that visually compare true housing prices against the model's predictions.
*   💾 **Persistent Output Storage**: Saves model predictions and detailed evaluation metrics, facilitating further analysis and reporting.
*   ⚙️ **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to run on various operating systems where Python and its dependencies are supported.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The core dataset, `housing_data.csv`, contains detailed housing information for properties across Polish cities. Key features include:

*   `latitude`: Geographic latitude of the property.
*   `longitude`: Geographic longitude of the property.
*   `floor`: The specific floor on which the property is located.
*   `rooms`: Total number of rooms within the property.
*   `sq`: The area of the property in square meters (m²).
*   `year`: The year the property was constructed.
*   `price`: **Target variable** – the actual price of the property.

This raw data is meticulously preprocessed and transformed into NumPy arrays (`train.npy`, `test.npy`, etc.) suitable for training and testing the neural network model.

## ⚙️ System Requirements
*   Python 3.7+
*   Libraries (see `Installation` for versions):
    *   NumPy
    *   Pandas
    *   Scikit-learn
    *   TensorFlow (>=2.x recommended)
    *   Matplotlib

## 🛠 Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository_url>` and `<repository_directory>` with your specific details)*

2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Required Libraries**:
    It's good practice to have a `requirements.txt` file. If you don't, you can create one with the typical versions:
    ```txt
    # requirements.txt
    numpy~=1.23
    pandas~=1.5
    scikit-learn~=1.2
    tensorflow~=2.10
    matplotlib~=3.6
    ```
    Then install using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Alternatively, install individually:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
    ```

## 💡 Usage Guide

Execute the scripts in the following order from the project's root directory. Ensure `housing_data.csv` is present.

1.  **Data Preprocessing**:
    This script loads the raw data, cleans it, performs feature engineering/scaling, and splits it into training and testing sets, saving them in the `data/` directory.
    ```bash
    python scripts/data_processing.py
    ```

2.  **Building the Model Architecture**:
    This script defines the neural network layers and saves the architecture (and optionally, an untrained model).
    ```bash
    python scripts/build_model.py
    ```

3.  **Training the Model**:
    This script loads the preprocessed training data and the model architecture, then trains the model, saving the trained version to the `models/` directory.
    ```bash
    python scripts/training.py
    ```

4.  **Evaluating the Model**:
    This script loads the trained model and the test data, evaluates its performance, and saves metrics and visualizations to the `outputs/` directory.
    ```bash
    python scripts/evaluate_model.py
    ```

## 🤖 Model Architecture

The neural network is a feedforward network specifically designed for regression tasks:

*   **Input Layer**: Accepts 6 input features corresponding to the dataset columns (latitude, longitude, floor, rooms, sq, year).
*   **Hidden Layers**:
    *   Multiple `Dense` layers (e.g., 128 units, then 64 units) employing the **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function for non-linearity.
    *   **Batch Normalization** layers are typically inserted after Dense layers (before activation) to stabilize and accelerate training.
    *   **Dropout** layers (e.g., with a rate of 0.2 or 0.3) are used for regularization to prevent overfitting.
*   **Output Layer**: A single `Dense` neuron with a **linear activation function**, as this is a regression problem predicting a continuous price value.
*   **Loss Function**: **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is used to quantify the difference between predicted and actual prices during training.
*   **Optimizer**: The **Adam optimizer** is employed for its efficiency and adaptive learning rate capabilities.

## ▶️ Results and Evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is primarily assessed using:

*   ✅ **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Quantifies the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. Lower is better.
*   ✅ **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It's the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation where all individual differences have equal weight. Lower is better, and it's in the same unit as the output variable (price).

### Visualization
*   🖼️ A scatter plot comparing **True Prices vs. Predicted Prices** is generated and saved as `true_vs_predicted.png` in the `outputs/` directory. This provides a visual assessment of the model's predictive accuracy and potential biases.

### Predictions Output
*   💾 The actual true prices and the model's predicted prices for the test set are saved as a CSV file (`predictions.csv`) in the `outputs/` directory, allowing for detailed inspection and further analysis.

## 📋 Important Notes

*   Ensure the input dataset (`housing_data.csv`) is correctly formatted and placed in the project's root directory before running the preprocessing script.
*   If you encounter character encoding issues when loading `housing_data.csv` with Pandas (e.g., with Polish city names or descriptions if they were present), try specifying an encoding:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    # df = pd.read_csv('housing_data.csv', encoding='latin1')
    # or
    # df = pd.read_csv('housing_data.csv', encoding='utf-8')
    ```
